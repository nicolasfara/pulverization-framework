# Deployment

At this point all the components are defined, the last step is create an executable for each component and containerize
it in order to deploy the system.

To do that, we create a simple main function in kotlin with the following elements:

```kotlin
fun main() = runBlocking {
  val deviceID = System.getenv("DEVICE_ID")?.toID() ?: error("No `DEVICE_ID` variable found")
  pulverizationSetup(deviceID, configuration) {
    registerComponent<DeviceBehaviour>(configuration["device"])
    registerComponent<DeviceState>(configuration["device"])
  }

  val behaviour = DeviceBehaviourComponent()
  behaviour.initialize()
  behaviour.cycle()
}
```

First of all we must specify the `DEVICE_ID`, in this case the ID is taken by an environment variable.
Later, we use a DSL for setting up the pulverization framework specifying which components needs to be "activated" for
that specific component.

After the setup the only remaining things to do is create the instance of our `DeviceComponent` in this case
the `DeviceBehaviourComponent`, initialize and run it.
